# Kotlin Project Tutorial

This is a Kotlin project, created by myself to make some exercise on Kotlin after a while not working with this language.
My objective is to make experiments and exercises on Kotlin used as a backend language for APIs and, eventually, CLI commands.

## Installation

Everything should be setted up from Gradle when first importing the project.

## Usage

To run the Application, use `./gradlew run`.
To run the tests, use `./gradlew test`.

You can also access this commands via Makefile. 

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome: consider that the purpose of this is learning, so feel free
to open a PR if you like, just be sure to open it with enough information to make me understand 
why you are suggesting those changes and which benefit will bring. Thanks!
